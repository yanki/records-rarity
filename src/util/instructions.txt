after you adjust the .connect() function call in each one,

RUN IN THIS ORDER


insertRandUsers.py
insertRandVinyls.py
connectUsersOwned.py
connectUsersWish.py


if you need to give the records in the database a rarity

giveRecordsRarity.py

and the search, user rarity functions are in the models.py
and should work without any modifications.
